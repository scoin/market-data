Byte Academy Workshop 2 - Storing Stock Data in a Database
=======================================================

Welcome to Byte Academy! Thank you for joining us for this special workshop event.

If you would like to see the readme and code for just the first workshop, switch to branch "workshop-1"

Let's get started, shall we?

You will need to do the following to get set up for this workshop:

On Ubuntu:

		sudo apt-get install python3-pip
		sudo pip3 install requests

On Mac:

Pip / Pip3 is automatically installed if you installed Python / Python3 with Homebrew. If you do not have Homebrew, install pip using:

		sudo easy_install pip
		pip install requests

On Windows:

Install Python3.4 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Install SQLite3 [here](http://www.sqlite.org/2014/sqlite-shell-win32-x86-3080702.zip)

Run this:

		pip install requests

We're also going to need MatPlotLib for making graphs today.

		pip install matplotlib
